# LYA RESTAURANTE
Actually, the system used in restaurants for customer service is the waiters who have several tasks: they present the menu, take orders, serve the food and drinks, clean the tables, prepare the food bill, are the link between the kitchen and the customer and maintain constant communication with the customers.  

Restaurants with high customer traffic require a considerably high number of waiters to attend customers in a fast and agile way. With the development of this project, for the first time the customer will be able to make his order through a voice-operated virtual assistance device, so that the customer does not have to wait for a waiter to take his order.
